        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Kirtan Kaila and I am a 3rd year applied computer science student.</p>

        <p> My love of technology and solving problems motivates me to keep improving my software development and programming skills. I've worked on a number of projects throughout my academic career that have improved my understanding of computer science concepts.  As I progress in my education,Â I can't wait to study more and put what I've learned to use in the real world.</p>
